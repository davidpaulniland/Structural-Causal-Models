# Structural Causal Models
 
Assignment which involves the use of structual causal models. 

The estimates of X's effects on Y is estimated from the data. 

𝑋  is the treatment: the dosage of a drug taken by a patient;

𝑌  is the outcome: a numerical score reflecting how well the patient recovered;

𝑍  is an additional variable that summarizes relevant genetic information about a patient.

𝑌  and  𝑍  are continuous (real-valued), while  𝑋  is discrete.

Inverse probability weighting, logistic regression, root mean squared error are some of the techniques used.
